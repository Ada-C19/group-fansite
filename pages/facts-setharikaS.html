      <h1>Bali, Indonesia</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my blog! This is my first time visiting Indonesia, i love to explore the culture and places. During my trip to bali i have learn so much from baliness life style. Bali is a extremely safe. People here are freindly and very helpful eventhough I don't khnow thier language. They are highly religiouse and spiritual where they pracetice these in thier daily life. People love nature here. I feel my mind was at peace and can't deny that i alway want to go back again one day. It was such a relaxation and advanturius at the same time.

      <h2>Atrraction</h2>
      <p>
        <li>Tegallalang Rice Terracese</li>
          <p>Tegallalang Rice Terraces are one of the most famous areas to photograph these iconic landscapes and absorb their timeless beauty. Be aware that locals ask for donations along the most popular trail through the rice fields here, and many request fees for entrance and parking along the road. A relaxing way to enjoy the lush landscapes is at one of the many restaurants and caf√©s overlooking the fields.</p>
        <li>Lempuyang</li>
          <p>Pura Luhur Lempuyang is one of Bali's most sacred temples, and one of the hardest to access.</p>
        <li>Pura Ulun Danu Bratane</li>
          <p>The 17th-century Pura Ulun Danu Bratan is one of Bali's most picturesque temple complexes. It sits on a small island along the western shore of Lake Bratan, in the cool highlands of central Bali. Set against the imposing backdrop of Gunung Bratan, the thatched temples reflect on the lake, and when the water levels rise, they seem to float on its surface.</p>
