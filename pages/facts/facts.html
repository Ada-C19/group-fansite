          <br>
          Dolly Rebecca Parton was born on January 19, 1946 on Locust Ridge, Sevier County, TN. She 
          grew up in a two-room cabin deep in Appalachia with 11 brothers and sisters.
          Her parents, Robert and Avie Lee Parton, had no idea their love of music would resonate so

          songwriting talent.</p>
