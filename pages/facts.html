    <h2>Background on the Show</h2>
    <p>SUGAR. SPICE. AND EVERYTHING NICE. The Powerpuff Girls aired from 1998 to 2005. It is an animated show following the adventures of three kindergarten-age sisters who have superpowers. They were created by Professor Utonium with a special ingredient called Chemical X, which allows them to fly and fight bad guys.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Powerpuff Girls (1998) names were based on Fauna, Flora, and Merryweather from the popular Disney movie, Sleeping Beauty (1959).</li>
      <li>The devilish, demonic rival named is referred to as "Him" because the producers thought the Devil or Satan or any other name would be too controversial for a kids' show.</li>
      <li>Originally called Whoopass Stew! (1992), the trio's name changed to The Powerpuff Girls (1998) when adult audiences disapproved of children hearing profanity.</li>
      <li>Sara Bellum is named after the cerebellum, likely because she is the "brains" of the mayor's occupation and city operations.</li>
      <li>The character design was influenced by Margaret Keane, an artist known for painting big eyes.</li>
