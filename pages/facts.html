      <h2>1. She was the daughter of Romantic poet Lord Byron</h2>
      <p>Ada Lovelace was born on 10 December 1815 in London, as Augusta Ada Byron, and was the only legitimate child of
        Lord George Gordon Byron and his wife Lady Annabella Byron. Today considered one of Britain’s greatest Romantic
        poets, Lord Byron was infamous for his many affairs and dark moods. </p>

      <h2>2. She excelled in science and mathematics from an early age</h2>
      <p>Though hampered by ill-health throughout her childhood, Ada excelled in her education – an education that
        thanks to her mother’s suspicion of the arts and love for mathematics, was rather unconventional for women at
        the time.</p>

      <h2>3. At the age of 12, Lovelace conceptualized a flying machine.</h2>
      <p>After studying the anatomy of birds and the suitability of various materials, the young girl illustrated plans
        to construct a winged flying apparatus before moving on to think about powered flight. “I have got a scheme,”
        she wrote to her mother, “to make a thing in the form of a horse with a steamengine in the inside so contrived
        as to move an immense pair of wings, fixed on the outside of the horse, in such a manner as to carry it up into
        the air while a person sits on its back.”</p>

    <section>
      <h2>4. The “father of the computer” was her mentor.</h2>
      <p>At the age of 17, Lovelace met inventor and mathematician Charles Babbage and watched him demonstrate a model
        portion of his difference engine, an enormous mathematical calculating machine that has led to his being dubbed
        the “father of the computer.” </p>

    <section>
      <h2>5. She wrote the first published computer program</h2>
      <p>In 1842, Ada was commissioned to translate a French transcript of one of Babbage’s lectures into English.
        Adding her own section simply titled ‘Notes’, Ada went on to write a detailed collection of her own ideas
        on Babbage’s computing machines that ended up being more extensive than the transcript itself!
        Within these pages of notes, Lovelace made history. In note G, she wrote an algorithm for the Analytical Engine
        to compute Bernoulli numbers, the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a
        computer, or in simple terms – the first computer program.</p>

      <h2>6.She was a hit amongst polite society</h2>
      <p>Though an astute scholar like her mother, Ada also dazzled in the realms of social society. At 17 she was
        introduced at court, becoming a ‘popular belle of the season’ on account of her ‘brilliant mind’.
        In 1835, aged 19 she married William, 8th Baron King, becoming Lady King. He was later made Earl of Lovelace,
        affording Ada the name she is now commonly known by. The pair shared a love of horses and had three children,
        each
        named as a nod to Ada’s parentage – Byron, Annabella, and Ralph Gordon. She and William enjoyed a pleasant life
        in
        society, mixing with the brightest minds of the day from Charles Dickens to Michael Faraday.</p>

      <h2>7. Her life was not without controversy</h2>
      <p>Not without some of her father’s controversial tendencies, in the 1840s Ada was reportedly involved with a
        selection of morally dubious activities. Chief of these was a nasty gambling habit, through which she racked up
        huge
        debts. At one point, she even attempted to create a mathematical model for successful large bets, which failed
        catastrophically and left her owing thousands of pounds to the syndicate. </p>

    <section>
      <h2>8. She fused the arts and science together in ‘poetical science’</h2>
      <p>Despite her mother’s best efforts to eradicate the arts from Lovelace’s life, she never fully relinquished the
        literary finesse she inherited from her father. Dubbing her approach ‘poetical science’, she placed great
        emphasis on using creativity and imagination to explore her work:</p>
      <p><em>“Imagination is the Discovering Faculty, pre-eminently. It is that which penetrates into the unseen worlds
          around us, the worlds of Science”</em></p>

      <h2>9. Her contributions to computing weren’t recognized until a century after her death.</h2>
      <p>Lovelace’s ideas about computing were so far ahead of their time that it took nearly a century for technology
        to
        catch up. While Lovelace’s notes on Babbage’s analytical engine gained little attention at the time they were
        originally published in 1843, they found a much wider audience when republished in B.V. Bowden’s 1953 book
        “Faster
        Than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines.” As the field of computer science dawned in the 1950s,
        Lovelace gained a new following in the digital age. </p>

      <h2>10. A computer programming language is named in Lovelace’s honor.</h2>
      <p>During the 1970s, the U.S. Department of Defense developed a high-order computer programming language to
        supersede
        the hundreds of different ones then in use by the military. When U.S. Navy Commander Jack Cooper suggested
        naming
        the new language “Ada” in honor of Lovelace in 1979, the proposal was unanimously approved. Ada is still used
        around
        the world today in the operation of real-time systems in the aviation, health care, transportation, financial,
        infrastructure and space industries.</p>
