          Caffe Latte, or simply known as "latte," originated in Italy in the 17th century. It is an espresso-based drink who's name translates to "milk coffee".

          The espresso to milk ratio is: one-third espresso and two-thirds steamed milk. It has a small layer of milk foam on top.

        The most popular Latte art design is called the "heart." It is a classic and widely recognized pattern that baristas create by pouring the steamed milk into the espresso in a specific manner.
