        <li>
          "A Bidet is too hard to install." This concern is a thing of the past. Bidets come with easy to follow instructions. The install process requires nothing more than what you would find in a normal tool box and works with your existing system. 10-15 minutes could give your butt a lifetime of cleanliness.
        </li>

        <li>
          "I will have to alter my plumbing to have a Bidet." Most Bidets work well with your existing plumbing. No additional drilling or modifications that need to be made to your existing set up. In order to have the added features of the best bidet models, you will need an electric outlet to attach to the electrical unit in the bidet.
        </li>

        <li>
          "Isn't electricity and water a bad mixture." Yes, it is! We don't recommend you dry your hair while in the bathtub. The electrical unit of the Bidet is housed in a protective casing and the cord can and should be run far from any potential water sources.
        </li>

        <li>
          "It is too embarrassing having a Bidet!" Bidets are popular all around the world in Japan, Korea, Europe or Canada. You will get to use it often in major Hotels and popular among home use.
