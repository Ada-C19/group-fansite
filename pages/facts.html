        <li>Bidets Banish Bacteria. Besides being nicely alliterative, this is a super true statement. By flushing bacteria out and away from the most sensitive areas of your body, bidets work to prevent conditions like bacterial prostatitis, an inflammatory condition that affects the prostates of about 8% of U.S. men. Left-behind bacteria can also cause itching and discomfort, which are some of the most common symptoms that drive people into the offices of colorectal surgeons</li> 
        <li>Bidets Help Prevent UTIs. If youâ€™re a woman who is curious about the history of and current place for bidets, hear this: bidets can help prevent UTIs caused by E. coli bacteria, which is the culprit in about 90% of all UTI cases.</li>
        <li> Bidets Decrease Discomfort. For women with scarring from perineal tears or episiotomies during childbirth, dry wiping can be an uncomfortable experience. Luckily, a bidet can help decrease this. By directing a comforting, warm stream of water at the affected areas, bidets cut down on irritation and friction for a more pleasant go.</li>

      <p class="accordion-body"><ul>
        <li>
          "A Bidet is too hard to install." This concern is a thing of the past. Bidets come with easy to follow instructions. The install process requires nothing more than what you would find in a normal tool box and works with your existing system. 10-15 minutes could give your butt a lifetime of cleanliness.
        </li>

        <li>
          "I will have to alter my plumbing to have a Bidet." Most Bidets work well with your existing plumbing. No additional drilling or modifications that need to be made to your existing set up. In order to have the added features of the best bidet models, you will need an electric outlet to attach to the electrical unit in the bidet.
        </li>

        <li>
          "Isn't electricity and water a bad mixture." Yes, it is! We don't recommend you dry your hair while in the bathtub. The electrical unit of the Bidet is housed in a protective casing and the cord can and should be run far from any potential water sources.
        </li>

        <li>
          "It is too embarrassing having a Bidet!" Bidets are popular all around the world in Japan, Korea, Europe or Canada. You will get to use it often in major Hotels and popular among home use. For decades other cultures have looked to Bidets to make sure they are fresh, clean, and hygienic in some very important areas. The person who learns from all is the wise one. Try one, and you will agree.

          "They are too hard to use." It's easier than washing your hands. Enough said.
