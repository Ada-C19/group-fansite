          <p>
            Clarified Milk Punch is a forgotten classic cocktail! This cocktail
            requires a lot of time and space which is why it's not commonly
            found on bar menus.

            How does it transform from opaque to clear?! The citrus interacts
            with the milk which causes it to curdle. Then you pour the liquid
            through a strainer which leaves behind the curdles and other solid
            ingredients. This leaves behind the beautiful clear liquid of the
            gods!
