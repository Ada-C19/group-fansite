      Early Life
      <br>
      <br>
        Dolly Rebecca Parton was born on January 19, 1946 on Locust Ridge, Sevier County, TN. She
        grew up in a two-room cabin deep in Appalachia with 11 brothers and sisters.
        Her parents, Robert and Avie Lee Parton, had no idea their love of music would resonate so
        deeply with Dolly.
        Taking on the Knoxville airwaves while still in the single digits, those around her knew of her developing
        songwriting talent.
