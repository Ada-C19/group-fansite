          The word "Taco"
        </h3>
        <p id="bigger">
          The word "taco" is quite new.
          It originated from Mexican silver miners in the 18th century. Gunpowder was wrapped in a paper like a “taquito” and inserted into rocks before detonation.<br><br>
          By this time, tacos were known as the food of the working class, which included miners. This resulted in their portable street food being called “tacos de minero“, also known as “miner’s tacos”.

        <p>
          Tacos were slowly introduced to the American mainstream in the early 1900s when Mexican migrants arrived to work on railroads and other jobs and brought their food with them as well.
