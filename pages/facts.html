          <li>They can live for up to 12 years</li>
          <p>Pet rabbits can live between eight to 12 years. So it's good to think about whether
            you can look
            after them for this amount of time before getting rabbits.</p>

          <li>They're masters of hearing</li>
          <p>Most rabbits can actually turn their ears 180 degrees. This rotation can pinpoint
            the exact location of a sound. Wow.</p>

          <li>Their eyesight isn't bad either</li>
          <p>Rabbits have almost 360 degree vision, but they are born with their eyes shut.</p>

          <li>Rabbits communicate using a secret code</li>
          <p>Well, it’s not actually a secret code, but you could be forgiven for thinking it is
            because
            their body movements are so subtle. Rabbits clench their facial muscles and change
            their body
            position when they are feeling worried; signs you wouldn’t notice if you weren’t
            looking out for
            them. This is one of the main reasons they’re so often misunderstood and don't get
            the correct
            care.</p>


          <li>Carrots aren't the best food for them</li>
          <p>Bugs Bunny has a lot to answer for. Root vegetables aren’t a natural part of a
            rabbit’s diet,
            and carrots are high in sugar so should only be fed occasionally and in small
            amounts.</p>
