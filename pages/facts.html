        <h3>Fun Fact 1: COFFEE WAS DISCOVERED BY AN ETHIOPIAN GOAT HERDER</h3>
        <p>The stimulating effects of coffee were discovered by a goat herder in Ethiopia 
          who noticed that his goats were particularly alert after consuming berries from a coffee tree.
          This knowledge spread like wildfire, and other goat herders and 
          monks noticed that coffee would help them stay awake for long periods</p>

        <h3>Fun Fact 2: YOU DON'T NEED TO DRINK COFFEE IN THE MORNING</h3>
        <p>Drinking coffee first thing in the morning is not helping you; it can actually hurt you, 
          by tricking your body into producing cortisol when it doesn't need to.
          That's because your body produces cortisol naturally as soon as you wake up.
          If you drink a lot of coffee early in the day, you will be very alert and 
          energeticâ€”but by noon, your cortisol levels will have dropped enough to make you feel lousy again. 
          If this pattern continues for several days in a row, you'll find that it's better to consume coffee 
          after lunch.</p>

        <h3>Fun Fact 3: COFFEE HELPS YOU LIVE LONGER</h3>
        <p>Some studies show that people who drink coffee are less likely to develop 
          depression or Alzheimer's disease, two conditions that shorten life expectancy.
          Researchers are also finding ways that coffee may help your body fight off other 
          chronic illnesses.
          Two chemicals in coffee, caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid, reduce inflammation 
          and exhibit antioxidant capacity. When consumed, they increase the level of 
          antioxidants in the body and decrease oxidative stress within cells, which can 
          slow down and even prevent cell damage and death by reducing free radical activity.
          That means the drink may also reduce your risk for cancer.</p>
