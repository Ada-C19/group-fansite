          <li>They can live for up to 12 years
            <p>Pet rabbits can live between eight to 12 years. So it's good to think about
              whether you can look after them for this amount of time before getting rabbits.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>They're masters of hearing
            <p>Most rabbits can actually turn their ears 180 degrees. This rotation can pinpoint
              the exact location of a sound. Wow.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Their eyesight isn't bad either
            <p>Rabbits have almost 360 degree vision, but they are born with their eyes shut.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>Rabbits communicate using a secret code
            <p>Well, it’s not actually a secret code, but you could be forgiven for thinking it
              is because their body movements are so subtle. Rabbits clench their facial muscles
              and change their body position when they are feeling worried; signs you wouldn’t
              notice if you weren’t looking out for them. This is one of the main reasons
              they’re so often misunderstood and don't get the correct care.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Carrots aren't the best food for them
            <p>Bugs Bunny has a lot to answer for. Root vegetables aren’t a natural part of a
              rabbit’s diet, and carrots are high in sugar so should only be fed occasionally
              and in small amounts.</p>
