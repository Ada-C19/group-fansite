      <h2>Origins of the Word Pork</h2>
      <p>
        Have you ever wondered why the names for animals in English is different from the 
        words we use to refer to the meat we eat? This can be traced back to the Norman 
        Conquest of Britain in the 11th century! Animals in the stables and in the farms
        kept their Old English names (like pig, cow, and sheep). However, when the animals 
        were cooked and served to the French-speaking upper-class, an anglicized version of
        the French words were used. "Porc" became "pork", "beouf" became "beef", and "mouton" 
        became "mutton." The lower-class Anglo-Saxons were the hunters, and therefore used the 
        old words to refer to the animals. The upper-class French saw the animals only during 
        mealtimes, and used the French word to describe the prepared dishes. That's why the 
        word's are different! <a href="https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/words-and-their-stories-pig-or-pork-cow-or-beef/4104856.html">Source</a>

      <h2>Al Pastor</h2>
      <p>
        Tacos <i>al pastor</i> were created in 1930 in Puebla, Mexico by Lebanese immigrants
        who introduced the region to classic shawarma. They would serve the shawarma (roast
        lamb cooked on a vertical grill) on pita bread or flour tortillas. Originally known 
        as <i>tacos árabes</i>, this dish eventually evolved into <i>tacos al pastor</i> 
        when the local Mexicans incorporated their own spice blends into the marinade.

      <h2>Meat-Shaped Stone 肉形石</h2>
      <p>
        This is unique piece of jasper carved into the shape of a piece of Dongpo pork, 
        a popular Chinese way of preparing pork belly. It is on display at the National Palace
        Museum in Taipei, Taiwan. Alongside the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadeite_Cabbage">Jadeite Cabbage</a> 
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Gong_Ding">Mao Gong Ding</a>, 
        the Meat-Shaped Stone is recognized as the most important item in the museum's collection. 
        The stone was carved from banded jasper during the Qing dynasty (1636 - 1912). Its many
        layers accumulated naturally over the years, and the artisan who carved the stone 
        stained the skin, resulting in a realistic look of multiple layers of fat and meat.
