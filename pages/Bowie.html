        Facts about Bowie
      </h2>
      <p>
        He's a puddle water somelier
       </p>
       <p>
        Loves the snow and was extremly disapointed when he realized it melted in spring 
      </p>
      <p>
        He recently lost his fear of water and has learned to swim, ironically he hates baths 
      </p>
      <p>
        He will give his walker exactly 40 seconds to put shoes on, you will hear his roar if you fail 
        <p>
        Bowie's mantra: No treat, No trick 
      </p>
      <p>
        He came from Texas but acts like he's alergic to the heat
      </p>
        <!-- <p>
        Bowie has come a long way from when he was first rescued, he peed when happy or frightened, he did not know
        how to go on walks, he tried to escape and succesfully did it for the first month, Bowie did not know how to play 
        with humans and did not know how to fetch (now he knows but is not interested)
