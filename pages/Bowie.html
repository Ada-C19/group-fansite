        Facts about Bowie
      </h2>
      <p>

        Bowie is a rescue pup, his shelter name was Pretz
        He is a puddle water somelier
        Loves the snow and was extremly disapointed when he realized it melted in spring 
        He recently lost his fear of water and has learned to swim, ironically he hates baths 
        He will give his walker exactly 40 seconds to put shoes on, you will hear his roar if you fail 
        Bowie loves the dog parks and is extremly social, he can be stubborn when asked to do a trick if no treat is on sight 
        He came from Texas but acts like his alergic to the heat
        Bowie has come a long way from when he was first rescued, he peed when happy or frightened, he did not know
        how to go on walks, he tried to escape and succesfully did it for the first month, Bowie did not know how to play 
        with humans and did not know how to fetch (now he knows but is not interested)
