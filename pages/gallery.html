          <p>Matcha is high in a catechin called EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), which is believed to have cancer-fighting effects on the body. Studies have linked green tea to a variety of health benefits, like helping to prevent heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer, and even encouraging weight loss.</p>

          <p>Milk tea is simply what it sounds like- tea with milk added. This combination creates a smoothness and slight sweetness to normal bitter teas such as black tea. Milk tea can be made into anything, such as bubble tea or masala chai tea. </p>

          <p>Rose tea is an aromatic herbal beverage made from the fragrant petals and buds of rose flowers. It's claimed to offer numerous health benefits, though many of these are not well supported by science.</p>

            Passion tea is a proprietary herbal tea blend. This refreshing drink is popular in the summer. It consists of hibiscus flowers, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, licorice root, orange peel, cinnamon, rosehips, lemongrass, and fruit juice extract for color.</p>

            <p>The ideal version would have rich tea flavor: tea with a backbone (but not unpleasant astringency or bitterness). It would have bright, fresh, real lemon in there, tart and tangy and sweetened just enough to make it drinkable by the pitcher. The mix would be bold and flavor-packed, not like bad tea and bad lemonade hiding in a glass of watery ice, hoping the combination can redeem them.</p> </li>

        <p>his strawberry bubble tea recipe tastes like strawberries and cream in a refreshing drink. The milk adds a creamy flavor to the strawberry compote while the jasmine green tea adds a slight bitterness that balances out the sweetness of the other ingredients.</p> </li>

        Coconut Butterfly Pea Flower Boba Tea - Sprinkle Bakes
        This drink is sweet and creamy with refreshing coconut flavor. The soft, chewy tapioca pearls make this half beverage, half snack. The butterfly pea flower tea is present more in color than flavor, but it's more than just a novelty to me. It's a whole new sandbox to play in!</p> </li>
