# Coworking Agreement
*Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.*

## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*
Ana:  summarize tasks at hand, punctuality 
Kathleen: need time to process.
Ariel: slow down before jumping in to take time to read directions on my own, patience 


## Collaboration vs. individual work expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations- does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*
We will work together to set up the HTML on the main page. Then we will each individually create our own page and come together for help, to discuss, and share ideas. 


## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*
Ana: take time to digest the info and make sense of it and talk it out to have overall understanding
Kathleen: come together after completing each smaller task and making sure we are all on the same page
Ariel: visuals are really important when you are discussing code and how it shows up on the front end


## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*
Ana: don’t give the answer right away, leave some time for you to figure it out on your own
Kathleen: direct feedback, some time to figure it out on your own and you are still stuck reaching out for help. If you are stubborn, ask if help is needed.
Ariel: if going down a rabbit hole, help recenter and ask guiding questions to get me back on track. 


## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*
Ana: time management, managing tasks for each day so we can complete the project, not being side side-tracked
Kathleen: Being proactive about checking in whether that is because I’m struggling or I’ve figured out what I am trying to do.
Ariel: checking in with the group so I don’t get behind, making sure I check with others to make sure we are all at the same checkpoint at the end of every task


## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
Enjoy the learning experience. Don’t forget to have fun. Don’t take it home.
