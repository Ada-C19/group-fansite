## Wave 3 - Layout

### Required Content

In this wave, work together to present the elements on the page as you see fit by using the following at least once:
* a grid container with a few grid items
* a flexbox container with a few flex items

Both of these containers do not need to be on the same page. Try using one for one page, and the other for another page!

### Non-Functional Requirements

The site should follow best practices, including:
  - All markup should be semantic, with consideration of hierarchy and accessibility
  - CSS should be concise and well-formatted
  - Images and stylesheets should be kept in their own folders, called `images` and `stylesheets`, respectively
  - Run your site through an [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload) and fix all errors before submitting

### Optional Enhancements

- Create a `blog/` directory. Within this directory...
  - create single `html` file for each entry in your blog/journal
  - update the nav on the rest of your site to reference each entry as a sublist/subnav.
  - update any tags with path references (`img`, `link`, `a` tags) to accommodate for the entries being in a different directory.
- Create any number of additional pages or directories.

### A Word of Caution

A lot of developers find their initial foray into CSS frustrating. Every browser implements the CSS standard a little (or a lot) differently. Learning to manipulate elements and understand the _box model_ takes time. Layout can be especially challenging to developers new to CSS. For this project, focus on understanding the mechanics and semantics of HTML and CSS, and how the two work together.

### Optional: Deploy with GitHub Pages
Want more? Make your site live on the internet! There are a lot of ways to go about hosting a live website, but GitHub provides a way to host static sites for free using your GitHub account. [Follow the steps listed here](https://pages.github.com/).
