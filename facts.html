                        <h3>The Origin of the Word Dessert</h3>
                        <p>
                            The word “dessert” actually originated from the French word desservir, meaning “to clear the table.” This refers to the fact that desserts are served after the other dishes are cleared off the table.

                            The Frrrozen Haute Chocolate ice cream sundae from a restaurant called Serendipity 3 in New York takes the cake as the most expensive dessert. It costs $25,000 and is so expensive partly due to the fact that it contains five grams of edible 23-karat gold.

                        <h3>The Origin of German Chocolate Cake</h3>
                        <p>
                            German chocolate cake isn’t German. It’s actually named after Samuel German, an American baker who worked at Baker’s Chocolate Company. He actually created a new type of baking chocolate that incorporated more sugar than typical semisweet chocolate.

                        <h3>How Profesisonal Taste Testers Eat Ice Cream</h3>
                        <p>
                            Ice cream testers use gold spoons for tasting the product instead of regular spoons. Gold eliminates even the slightest “after-taste” that can be caused by the metal or plastic from regular spoons.

                            The chocolate river in the movie Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was made of real chocolate. It contained 150,000 gallons of water mixed with chocolate and cream. The cream made the mixture spoil pretty quickly on set.

                        <p>
                            Legend says that the candy cane was invented to keep children quiet in church. In 1670, a choirmaster in Germany handed out sugar sticks among the young singers to keep them quiet during a Christmas ceremony and bent the candies into shepherds’ crooks for the occasion.
