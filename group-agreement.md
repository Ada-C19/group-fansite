Collaboration vs. individual work expectations
    - open communication, r e s p e c t, we are learning - have fun and don't take it too seriously.
    - make this an in-class assignment: if we can't finish we can do at home individually and explain what we did to each other next day.
    - no one should be left behind, ask if we are not understanding, safe space.

Clarify your collaboration expectations- does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?
