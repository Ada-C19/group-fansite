# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*

- Julie will be online Thursday.
- Just work together in-person during coworking time.

## Collaboration vs. individual work expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations- does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

- Each work on our own page. Do some agreements on general style sheet. 

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*

- Lou: Likes watching things break and understanding why they break.
- Mel: Visually, looking at examples.
- Julie: Working alongside one another and talking through our approach.

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*

- Direct feedback when possible. Don't be mean about it, focus on what you're giving feedback on and what best practices are. 
- Jokes are a plus.

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*

- Lou: Self-conscious about grammar, generally wants to improve team communication in English.
