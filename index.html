      <h2>Bananas: Good for you, good for the world</h2>
      <p>
        A banana is an elongated, edible fruit botanically a berry produced by
        several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. In
        some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains",
        distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size,
        color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft
        flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow,
        red, purple, or brown when ripe.
